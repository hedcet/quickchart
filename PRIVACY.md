# privacy policy for quickchart

**last updated:** 2025-07-13

this document explains how we handle information for the `quickchart` open-source project, available at https://github.com/hedcet/quickchart.

### information we collect

we do **not** collect any personally identifiable information (pii) from you. the software runs locally and does not send data to our servers, except as described below.

### github interactions

when you interact with this project on github (e.g., creating issues or pull requests), that activity is public and governed by github's own privacy policy.

### third-party services

to render charts, this app uses the public `quickchart.io` api. we send aggregated, non-personal chart configuration data (such as chart labels and values) to their service, which returns a chart image. no personally identifiable information is sent.

for more details, please review the [quickchart.io privacy policy](https://quickchart.io/privacy-policy/).

### changes to this policy

we may update this policy. any changes will be reflected in the "last updated" date.
